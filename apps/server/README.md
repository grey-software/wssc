# Community Cleanup

Software that allow citizens to file complaints regarding garbage, sanitary issues, water supply, WSSCM staff, and other relevant issues that fall under the purview of the WSSCM.


## ü•Ö Motivation 

**üë§ AG**: As a resident of Pakistan, I see garbage thrown illegally and burned recklessly. Despite my personal efforts to ameliorate the problem, there has to be a larger, coordinated effort that involves the municipal and WSSCs corporations that are responsible for collecting garbage along with water sanitation issues accordingly. 


## Objectives

The main objectives of our proposed system are as follows: 

- To Build a Complaint management system for WSSCM.
- To integrate with their existing system (Odoo-MIS).
- To equip citizens with a functional and convenient app to file complaints.


## üëÅÔ∏è Vision 

Citizens will have a mobile app with which they can:

- Report areas of dumped garbage
- Request garbage cleanup and Water Sanitation from their municipality and WSSC
- Request for collection points to be placed in their areas 
- File complaints regarding garbage, sanitary issues, water supply, WSSCM staff, and other relevant issues.


The municipalities and WSSCs will have a web and mobile dashboard with which they can:

- Monitor the incoming requests for garbage cleanup, water sanitation or collection points from users.
- Manage collection operations, with live updates coming from the deployed collectors  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

### Platforms

This system requires:

- A mobile app for citizens
- A web and mobile dashboard for municipal and WSSC corporations

Due to the advances in web technologies, we recommend deploying this system on the web, where citizens will use a Progressive Web App and the government can use a web dashboard. This will allow developers to share code and mitigate the need for maintaining multiple versions for each platform. 

### Data Storage

The garbage markers users place and the pictures they take will be sent to the servers deployed by the municipal corporations. It is likely that this data won't be of a sensitive nature, so it could fall under open government data. If a rewards system is put in place that requires verification of a citizen's data, then measures will have to be taken to ensure that data remains accessible only to the municipal corporations.

## Project Status

Garbage Collector was formally ideated on Github on the 14th of November, 2020
The project invites any willing Product Owners, Designers, and Engineers.
